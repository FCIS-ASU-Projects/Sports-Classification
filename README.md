# Sports-Classification

- Our proplem is to build a CNN model that is able to classify different sports activities images into different categories.
- We have 6 categories (Basketball, Football, Rowing, Swimming, Tennis, Yoga).
- We use several CNN models (ex:Xception, GoogleNet, VGG16, ResNet50) tring to achieve best accuracy.
- Our best model was Xception model with Test accuracy: 0.905, Validation accuracy = 0.9615, Training accuracy = 0.9970.
